# README – IP Addressing Notes

## 📖 Overview
This document provides foundational notes on **IP Addressing**, **Decimal Numbers**, and **Binary Numbers**.  
It is structured to help learners understand how IP addresses are represented, how decimal and binary systems work, and how to perform conversions between them.

## 📂 Contents
1. **IP Addressing**
   - Explanation of IP address classes (A, B, C)
   - Subnet masks
   - CIDR ranges
   - Example addresses:
     - `30.0.0.0` → Class A, `/8`
     - `162.53.0.0` → Class B, `/16`
     - `193.25.20.0` → Class C, `/24`

2. **Decimal Numbers**
   - Basic explanation of the decimal system
   - Place values using powers of 10
   - Worked example: breaking down `537` into place values

3. **Binary Numbers**
   - Definition and explanation of binary (base-2 system)
   - Place values using powers of 2
   - Representation of an 8-bit binary address
   - Example: `11111111` = `255` in decimal

4. **Conversions**
   - Step-by-step conversion of `30.0.0.0` from decimal to binary
   - Conversion of binary `00011110.00000000.00000000.00000000` back to decimal (`30.0.0.0`)

## 🎯 Purpose
The notes are designed as a **learning resource** for students studying:
- Networking basics
- Computer science fundamentals
- IP addressing and subnetting
- Number systems (decimal and binary)

---

## ⚡ How to Use
- Read through the sections in order for a structured understanding.  
- Use the examples as practice for manual conversions.  
- Apply the concepts when learning about **subnetting**, **network classes**, and **binary arithmetic** in networking.
